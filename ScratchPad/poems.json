Briefly,\nit involved living the way philosophers live,\naccording to a set of principles. OK, but which ones?\n\nThat was the hardest part, I admit, but I had a\nkind of dark foreknowledge of what it would be like.\nEverything, from eating watermelon or going to the bathroom\nor just standing on a subway platform, lost in thought\nfor a few minutes, or worrying about rain forests,\nwould be affected, or more precisely, inflected\nby my new attitude.  I wouldn't be preachy,\nor worry about children and old people, except\nin the general way prescribed by our clockwork universe.\nInstead I'd sort of let things be what they are\nwhile injecting them with the serum of the new moral climate\nI thought I'd stumbled into, as a stranger\naccidentally presses against a panel and a bookcase slides back,\nrevealing a winding staircase with greenish light\nsomewhere down below, and he automatically steps inside\nand the bookcase slides shut, as is customary on such occasions.\nAt once a fragrance overwhelms him--not saffron, not lavender,\nbut something in between.  He thinks of cushions, like the one\nhis uncle's Boston bull terrier used to lie on watching him\nquizzically, pointed ear-tips folded over. And then the great rush \nis on.  Not a single idea emerges from it.  It's enough\nto disgust you with thought.  But then you remember something\n   William James\nwrote in some book of his you never read--it was fine, it had the\n   fineness,\nthe powder of life dusted over it, by chance, of course, yet\n   still looking\nfor evidence of fingerprints. Someone had handled it\neven before he formulated it, though the thought was his and\n   his alone.\n\nIt's fine, in summer, to visit the seashore.\nThere are lots of little trips to be made.\nA grove of fledgling aspens welcomes the traveler.  Nearby\nare the public toilets where weary pilgrims have carved\ntheir names and addresses, and perhaps messages as well,\nmessages to the world, as they sat\nand thought about what they'd do after using the toilet\nand washing their hands at the sink, prior to stepping out\ninto the open again.  Had they been coaxed in by principles,\nand were their words philosophy, of however crude a sort?\nI confess I can move no farther along this train of thought--\nsomething's blocking it.  Something I'm \nnot big enough to see over.  Or maybe I'm frankly scared.\nWhat was the matter with how I acted before?\nBut maybe I can come up with a compromise--I'll let\nthings be what they are, sort of.  In the autumn I'll put up jellies\nand preserves, against the winter cold and futility,\nand that will be a human thing, and intelligent as well.\nI won't be embarrassed by my friends' dumb remarks,\nor even my own, though admittedly that's the hardest part,\nas when you are in a crowded theater and something you say\nriles the spectator in front of you, who doesn't even like the idea\nof two people near him talking together. Well he's \ngot to be flushed out so the hunters can have a crack at him--\nthis thing works both ways, you know. You can't always\nbe worrying about others and keeping track of yourself\nat the same time.  That would be abusive, and about as much fun\nas attending the wedding of two people you don't know.\nStill, there's a lot of fun to be had in the gaps between ideas.\nThat's what they're made for!  Now I want you to go out there\nand enjoy yourself, and yes, enjoy your philosophy of life, too.\nThey don't come along every day. Look out!  There's a big one...","\n"],"5":["\nAt night the states\nI forget them or I wish I was there\n\t in that one under the\nStars.

We enclose them like dolls in glass cases and decorate our houses with them.","   People, especially the cultivated ones from old families, live surrounded by multitudes of dignified dead. Our living rooms and parlors, even our dining rooms and our bedrooms, are filled with our ancestors in glass cases. When the rooms become too full, we use the cases for furniture.","   On top of where my twenty-five-year-old great-grandmother lies, beautiful and buried in flowers, we line up the evening soup bowls.","2","   We do not sing in chorus. When four people gather, we weave together four different melodies. This is what we call a relationship. Such encounters are always a sort of entanglement. When these entanglements come loose, we scatter in four directions, sometimes with relief, sometimes at wit's end.","3","   I wrote that we scatter in four directions, but I did not mean that we merely return home, scattering from one another like rays of light radiating from a single source.","   When there is no more need to be together, we scatter in four different directions, but none of us ever breaks the horizon with our tread.","   Because people are afraid at the thought of their feet leaving the earth, we turn around one step before reaching the horizon. After thirty years, those faces we wished to see never again enter our fields of vision.","4","   In this country, everyone fears midday. In the daytime, the dead are too dead. Bathed in the sharp view of the sun, our skin crawls, and we shudder.","   When the nights, vast and deaf, vast and blind, descend with size great enough to fill the distances between us, we remove our corsets and breathe with relief. When we lie down to sleep at the bottom of the darkness, we are nearly as content as the corpses around us.","5","   The sight of fresh new leaves scares us. Who is to say that those small buds raising their faces upon the branches are not our own nipples? Who is to say that the soft, double blades of grass stretching from the wet earth are not the slightly parted lips of a boy?","6","   In the springtime, when green begins to invade our world, there is no place for us to take refuge outside, and so we hide in the deepest, darkest recesses of our houses. Sometimes we crane our necks from where we hide between our dead brothers, and we gaze at the green hemisphere swelling before our eyes. We are troubled by many fevers; we live with thermometers tucked under our arms.","   Do you know what it means to be a woman, especially to be a woman in this country, during the spring?","   When I was fifteen, becoming a woman frightened me. When I was eighteen, being a woman struck me as loathsome. Now, how old am I? I have become too much of a woman. I can no longer return to being human; that age is gone forever. My head is small, my neck long, and my hair terribly heavy.","7","   We can smile extremely well. So affable are our smiles that they are always mistaken for the real thing. Nonetheless, if by some chance our smiles should go awry, we fall into a terrible state. Our jaws slacken, and our faces disintegrate into so many parts.","   When this happens, we cover our faces with our handkerchiefs and withdraw. Shutting ourseleves alone in a room, we wait quietly until our natural grimace returns.","8","   During our meals, sometimes a black, glistening insect will dart diagonally across the table. People know perfectly well where this giant insect comes from. When it dashes between the salad and the loaf of bread, people fall silent for a moment, then continue as if nothing had happened.","   The insect has no name. That is because nobody has ever dared talk about it.","9","   Three times each day, all of the big buildings sound sirens. The elementary schools, theaters, and even the police stations raise a long wail like that of a chained beast suffering from terrible tedium.","   No matter where one is in this country, one cannot escape this sound—not even if one is making love, not even if one peering into the depths of a telescope.","   Yes, there are many telescopes in this country. There is always a splendid telescope at each major intersection in town. People here like to see things outside of their own country. Every day many people, while looking through the lens of one of these telescopes, are struck by stray cars and killed.","10","   When the faint aroma of the tide wafts upon the wind into town, people remember that this country lies by the sea. This sea, however, is not there for us to navigate; it is there to shut us in.

The wolf had been cut out of black stone, made blacker by the garden’s shadows, and she stood in profile, her elegant head pointed toward something far beyond her, her long unmarked body and legs—narrower and more finely-boned than the body and legs of wolves as we know them—possessed, it seemed, of a great stillness, like the saturated stillness of the roses, but tightly-nerved, set, on the instant, to move. Under her belly, stood the boys, under her black breasts, not babes, as one might expect, but two lean boys, cut from the same shadowed stone as the wolf, but disproportionately small, grown boys no bigger than starlings, though still, like the wolf, oddly fine of face and limb, one boy pressing four fingers again one long breast, his other cupped beneath it to catch the falling milk, the second boy wrapping both arms around another breast, as if to carry it off, neither boy suckling, both instead turned toward you, dreamy, sweetly sly, as if to chide you for interrupting their feeding, or as if they were plotting a good trick… Beautiful, those boys among the roses. Beautiful, the black wolf. But it was the breasts that held the eye, a double row of four black breasts, eight smooth breasts, each narrowing to a strict point, piercing sharp, exactly the shape of the ivory tooth of the shark."],"241":["\nMy friend Michael and I are walking home arguing about the movie.\nHe says that he believes a person can love someone\nand still be able to murder that person.\n\nI say, No, that's not love.

There is no fence, though here and there a weathered post asserts a former claim, strands of fallen wire taken by the dust. To the left a cornfield carries into the distance, dips and rises to the blue sky, a rolling plain of green and healthy plants aligned in close order, row upon row upon row. To the right, a field of wheat, a field of hay, young grasses breaking the soil, filling their allotted land with the rich, slow-waving spectacle of their grain. As for the farmers, they are, for the most part, indistinguishable: here the tractor is red, there yellow; here a pair of dirty hands, there a pair of dirty hands. They are cultivators of the soil. They grow crops by pattern, by acre, by foresight, by habit. What corn is to one, wheat is to the other, and though to some eyes the similarities outweigh the differences it would be as unthinkable for the second to commence planting corn as for the first to switch over to wheat. What happens in the gully between them is no concern of theirs, they say, so long as the plough stays out, the weeds stay in the ditch where they belong, though anyone would notice the wind-sewn cornstalks poking up their shaggy ears like young lovers run off into the bushes, and the kinship of these wild grasses with those the farmer cultivates is too obvious to mention, sage and dun-colored stalks hanging their noble heads, hoarding exotic burrs and seeds, and yet it is neither corn nor wheat that truly flourishes there, nor some jackalopian hybrid of the two. What grows in that place is possessed of a beauty all its own, ramshackle and unexpected, even in winter, when the wind hangs icicles from the skeletons of briars and small tracks cross the snow in search of forgotten grain; in the spring the little trickle of water swells to welcome frogs and minnows, a muskrat, a family of turtles, nesting doves in the verdant grass; in summer it is a thoroughfare for raccoons and opossums, field mice, swallows and black birds, migrating egrets, a passing fox; in autumn the geese avoid its abundance, seeking out windrows of toppled stalks, fatter grain more quickly discerned, more easily digested. Of those that travel the local road, few pay that fertile hollow any mind, even those with an eye for what blossoms, vetch and timothy, early forsythia, the fatted calf in the fallow field, the rabbit running for cover, the hawk's descent from the lightning-struck tree.

Rather it's the earth that has lurched under us like a moving sidewalk in an airport, some passengers standing, others rushing past, the bleep-bleep of the golf carts joyriding the elderly to one of their final destinations. Or when the airliner or the train next to yours moves and you think you've moved. This is not to say that it is only a matter of perception, but that the classics do not console enough. Or maybe that they console too much. You talk about Brutus's purple mantle, and Anthony's decision to behead the poor soul who stole it. If you don't think it's about consolation then why revert back to that code? And Horace's farm, a gift from a patron who loved his poetry, or merely loved the idea of befriending a poet and patronizing him. You'd only have to watch TV to see traces of that, \"the artist\" surrounded by his entourage, the affluence factor a tax deduction, the drugs an entertainment expense, a hedge fund exec with a salary (payment made in salt) of five hundred million dollars, the acreage outside his mansion the size of modern day Carthage. You only have to see the present to realize how false the past can be. Again, Horace's farm, his free-range cows feeding on acorns. Acorns! and the spring was mere superstition, or nostalgia steeped in superstition, and the cows an easy romanticism. But what of the air that feeds the thinking? This country will consume forty five million metric tons of beef, thirty two million of pork. Maybe you're thinking of Ulysses now, doing a cameo as a swineherd a few miles downwind from you where the levels of sulfur in the nearby springs are three thousand times what is humanly tolerable.

His reply—More than we can bear—caused me to turn and look at him as if for the first time. It is true that we carry the idea of us along with us. And then there are three thousand of us dead and it is incomprehensible and ungraspable. Physically and emotionally we cannot bear it, should in fact never have this capacity. So when the number is released it is a sieve that cannot hold the loss of us, the loss Giuliani recognized and answered for.","Wallace Stevens wrote that \"the peculiarity of the imagination is nobility . . . nobility which is our spiritual height and depth; and while I know how difficult it is to express it, nevertheless I am bound to give a sense of it. Nothing could be more evasive and inaccessible. Nothing distorts itself and seeks disguise more quickly. There is a shame of disclosing it and in its definite presentation a horror of it. But there it is.\"","Sir Giuliani kneeling. It was apparently not something to be seen on television, but rather a moment to be heard and experienced; a moment that allowed his imagination’s encounter with death to kneel under the weight of the real."],"349":["There was a time I could say no one I knew well had died. This is not to suggest no one died. When I was eight my mother became pregnant. She went to the hospital to give birth and returned without the baby. Where's the baby? we asked. Did she shrug? She was the kind of woman who liked to shrug; deep within her was an everlasting shrug. That didn't seem like a death. The years went by and people only died on television—if they weren't Black, they were wearing black or were terminally ill. Then I returned home from school one day and saw my father sitting on the steps of our home. He had a look that was unfamiliar; it was flooded, so leaking. I climbed the steps as far away from him as I could get. He was breaking or broken. Or, to be more precise, he looked to me like someone understanding his aloneness. Loneliness. His mother was dead. I'd never met her. It meant a trip back home for him. When he returned he spoke neither about the airplane nor the funeral."," ","Every movie I saw while in the third grade compelled me to ask, Is he dead? Is she dead? Because the characters often live against all odds it is the actors whose mortality concerned me. If it were an old, black-and-white film, whoever was around would answer yes. Months later the actor would show up on some latenight talk show to promote his latest efforts. I would turn and say—one always turns to say—You said he was dead. And the misinformed would claim, I never said he was dead. Yes, you did. No, I didn't. Inevitably we get older; whoever is still with us says, Stop asking me that."," ","Or one begins asking oneself that same question differently. Am I dead? Though this question at no time explicitly translates into Should I be dead, eventually the suicide hotline is called. You are, as usual, watching television, the eight-o'clock movie, when a number flashes on the screen: I-800-SUICIDE. You dial the number. Do you feel like killing yourself? the man on the other end of the receiver asks. You tell him, I feel like I am already dead. When he makes no response you add, I am in death's position. He finally says, Don't believe what you are thinking and feeling. Then he asks, Where do you live?","Fifteen minutes later the doorbell rings. You explain to the ambulance attendant that you had a momentary lapse of happily. The noun, happiness, is a static state of some Platonic ideal you know better than to pursue. Your modifying process had happily or unhappily experienced a momentary pause. This kind of thing happens, perhaps is still happening. He shrugs and in turn explains that you need to come quietly or he will have to restrain you. If he is forced to restrain you, he will have to report that he is forced to restrain you. It is this simple: Resistance will only make matters more difficult. Any resistance will only make matters worse. By law, I will have to restrain you. His tone suggests that you should try to understand the difficulty in which he finds himself. This is further disorienting. I am fine! Can't you see that! You climb into the ambulance unassisted."],"350":["Tracery","Not nostalgia but the bluer salt of longing, not sentiment but the smutted sky raining bitter sediment, not our winding blunder down into that wound, not the ash-riddled grotto nor the blood-orange blown-open","Not the mineral rash’s voice dubbed across the final unspooling reel, not that, whatever promise the book held, not what she said or he did or they might next, not that, nor a flitter of birds, hands—lifting a cup, flipping a page, tucking a strand, nor the ear, behind which, filling with each sweet rising note or tinkling descent","Not the delicacy of a single wish, nor the now-cracked face of a once-ticking, once-pocketed watch","Stitch","No filament long enough","No longer meshing, days before and those after, teeth of a zipper left to gape","An idling car, a parked pick-up, who hides in plain light who hides and why, cloaked in a troubled forest of unsayable tint","And which human desire does this resemble, which cosseting vest to cross the heart, which chilled sweat, which strait-jacketed vestment, which surely-numbing drone between temples","Resist","Faith in what","No walls, no shelves","No end to the well’s filling, the far-away sea’s waxy surge in a hole dug by anyone no matter, a relentless urge to pick the itch, the ooze, the scab, the meniscus of every hour finally spilling over, over, over","Nothing","But sound, but imprinted air","No end to the fraught tingle of phantom-limbs forever-after-not-but-there","Scar","Splinters the alley’s new stuttering currency, pocked, crumbling, indiscriminate coinage of returning light, triage of needling memory, a narrow strait to navigate, some beast, uneasy passage of meat into pure spirit, and every anguished ether-shard hive-swarming then hushed","Not ","silent"," but charged:  ","listen","...","Every letter, accounted for but in a different more urgent order"],"351":["A man walks into a ","museum in Paris, the Museum","of Natural History, to saw"," ","a tusk off an elephant-","skeleton centuries-older than  ","he’ll ever be, becoming","in those early morning hours  ","part of a derelict and","inglorious human history,"," ","while swallows darn the air","in loops, their glinting wings  ","an origami of hushed folds","only glimpsed by one vigilant ","girl, framed as she is within","a pane of glass, the door of her","heart opening onto a filigreed","balcony that keeps her  ","suspended, an unlikely wish","about someone not coming","back.

More About the Dead Man and Nothing\n\nDon't bet he won't be born.\nBefore all this, this that is so much, he was not himself.\nHe was the free heat of space and then the salt of the earth.\nHe was the ring around the moon, foretelling.\nThe dead man had no station when he came to be, just a strange nakedness in the light.\nHe did not know what he was to do, this was before clocks.\nSo he decided to stab the dirt, to tumble in happiness and writhe in pain, and to flap his way \n     into space.\nTo go home.\nIt was a swell idea for the dead man, and he pinned it to his chest.\nGive him that, that he crystallized a plan, that he made from smoke something to him as real as \n     quartz, ivory, or the hoof of a gelding.\nThe dead man had the whole world to transform or perfect or outlive.\nHe wrote the book of nothing and no-time that entombed all time and all that took place in time.\nThe dead man could not be hammered by analysis.\nLet him horn in on your fury, whatever it was, and it will abate.\nThe energy that became form will disperse, never again to be what we were.\nLook out the window to see him, no, the other one.","\n"],"391":["Live as if you were already dead",".","                          Zen admonition","\n","\n","1.

Weston's book on the Grail legend: ","From Ritual to Romance"," (Macmillan). Indeed, so deeply am I indebted, Miss Weston's book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can do; and I recommend it (apart from the great interest of the book itself) to any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble. To another work of anthropology I am indebted in general, one which has influenced our generation profoundly; I mean ","The Golden Bough","; I have used especially the two volumes ","Adonis, Attis, Osiris",".

Where shall I find\nBravura adequate to this great hymn?\n\nX.\nThe fops of fancy in their poems leave\nMemorabilia of the mystic spouts,\nSpontaneously watering their gritty soils.\nI am a yeoman, as such fellows go.\nI know no magic trees, no balmy boughs,\nNo silver-ruddy, gold-vermilion fruits.\nBut, after all, I know a tree that bears\nA semblance to the thing I have in mind.\nIt stands gigantic, with a certain tip\nTo which all birds come sometime in their time.\nBut when they go that tip still tips the tree.\n\nXI.\nIf sex were all, then every trembling hand\nCould make us squeak, like dolls, the wished-for words.\nBut note the unconscionable treachery of fate,\nThat makes us weep, laugh, grunt and groan, and shout\nDoleful heroics, pinching gestures forth\nFrom madness or delight, without regard\nTo that first, foremost law.

It supports the many invisible synthetic demands of industry-dependent living from insulants to binding agents. It has naturally assisted in the solidification of soap, the rising of bread, egg whites, and soufflés since the 17th century. The old ponce pumice stone works on hard callouses. Once exploded it can be hard as ash. The skeletal containers of dead sponges were used by Romans for brushes and combs, and for cups. Proust's memory work is foamic in a foam-lined room. A sudden foaming from the mouth for instance is the warning of miles of a thick sluggish matter heaped along coastlines, or bubbling up, obstructing the flow of vast industrial evacuation conduits. Matter turns unwelcoming, seemingly unregonisable. A persistent reactivity to events in its surroundings acts on a profound imbalance, the sign of a system being worked beyond capacity. Foams everywhere like the letter e, down to the alveolar structure."],"847":["O Thou bright jewel in my aim I strive","To comprehend thee.

I sorted out the carbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila envelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare. I went into the other room. I wanted to lock the office and shove off. I put my hand on his shoulder. I can't do it. I didn't sleep all last night. I could picture it.

I watched a good-looking girl walk past the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her. I caught her eye. I saw why she made a point of not laughing. I paid for the saucers. I hailed a horse-cab. I put my arm around her. I put her hand away. I called to the cocher to stop. I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be nice to eat with some one. I had forgotten how dull it could be. I got hurt in the war. I was bored enough. I went back to the small room. I went over to the bar. I drank a beer. I could see their hands and newly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door. I was very angry. I know they are supposed to be amusing. I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar. I knew then that they would all dance with her. I sat down at a table. I asked him to have a drink. I was a little drunk. I got up and walked over to the dancing-floor. I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and out it on. I stopped at the bar and asked them for an envelope. I took a fiftyfranc note from my pocket.","Chapter IV","I saw her face in the lights from the open shops. I saw her face clearly. I kissed her. I was pretty well through with the subject. I went out onto the sidewalk. I did not see who it was. I wanted to get home. I stopped and read the inscription. I knocked on the door and she gave me my mail. I wished her good night and went upstairs. I looked at them under the gaslight. I got out my check-book. I felt sure I could remember anybody. I lit the lamp beside the bed. I sat with the windows open and undressed by the bed. I looked at myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed. I put on my pajamas and got into bed. I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their wrappers off. I read it all the way through. I blew out the lamp. I wonder what became of the others. I was all bandaged up. I never used to realize it. I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. I couldn't keep away from it. I started to cry. I woke up. I listened. I thought I recognized a voice. I put on a dressing-gown. I heard my name called down the stairs. I looked at the clock. I was getting brandy and soda and glasses. I went back upstairs. I took them both to the kitchen. I turned off the gas in the dining-room. I had felt like crying. I thought of her walking up the street. I felt like hell again.","Chapter V","I walked down the Boulevard. I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette. I passed the man with the jumping frogs. I stepped aside. I read the French morning papers. I shared a taxi. I banged on the glass. I went to the office in the elevator. I was looking over my desk. I held him off. I left him to come to the office.","Chapter VI","I sat down and wrote some letters. I went down to the bar. I looked for her upstairs on my way out. I saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current. I suppose it is. I walked past the sad tables. I watched him crossing the street through the taxis. I never heard him make one remark. I do not believe he thought about his clothes much. I don't know how people could say such terrible things. I don't even feel an impulse to try to stop it. I stood against the bar looking out. I did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. I looked back. I went down a side street. I got in and gave the driver the address to my flat.","Chapter VII","I went up to the flat. I put the mail on the table. I heard the door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers. I filled the big earthenware jug with water. I dressed slowly. I felt tired and pretty rotten. I took up the brandy bottle. I went to the door. I found some ash-trays and spread them around. I looked at the count. I had that feeling of going through something that has already happened before. I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated, something I had been through and that now I must go through again. I took a note out of my pocket. I looked back and there were three girls at his table. I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap. I went upstairs and went to bed.","Note from the author: \"When I was 13, my brother gave me a copy of Hemingway's ","The Sun Also Rises",". It was my first foray into real Literature and I hated it.

I picked it up.","OK.","What about my hand?","Well, you're not being truthful with me. I'm kind of disappointed in you Senator. I'm really disappointed right now. OK. I'm not...just so you know. Just like everybody...","Yep...","...I I I treat with dignity, I try to pull them away from the situation and not embarrass them...","I appreciate that.

You're gonna have to pay a fine and that'll be it. OK? And I don't call media. I don't do anything of that type of crap.","Fine.","OK?","Fine.","Alright. So let's start from the beginning. You're in the bathroom.","I went to the bathroom.","Then what did you do when you went in?","I stood beside the wall waiting for a stall to open. I got in the stall, sat down, and I started to go to the bathroom. Uh, did our feet come together? Apparently they did bump. Well, I don't dispute that.","OK, when I got out of the stall I know that...I noticed that other stalls were open. Was there any...","They were at the time. At the time I entered I I...At the time I entered I stood and waited.","OK.","They they were all busy, you know?","Were you looking at me while you were waiting? I could see your eyes. I could see you plant your fingers and look up.","Did I glance at your stall? I was glancing at a stall right beside yours waiting for a fellow to empty it.I saw him stand up. And therefore I thought it was gonna empty.","How long do you think you stood in front of that stall?","Oh, a minute or two at the most.","OK. When you went in the stall, then what?","I sat down.","Did you do anything with your feet?","Positioned them? I don't know. I don't know, at the time. I'm a fairly wide guy. I...","I understand.","I tend to spread my legs...","OK.","...when I lower my pants so they won't slide. OK? Did I slide them too close to yours? Did I...? I looked down once your foot was close to mine.","Yes.","Did we bump? Uh, you said so. I don't recall that but apparently we were close.","Yeah. Well, your foot did touch mine on my side of the stall.","Alright.","OK. And, then with the hand, um, how many times did you put your hand under the stall?","I I don't recall. I I remember reaching down once. There was a piece of toilet paper back behind me and I recall picking it up.","OK. Was your was your pa...palm down or up when you were doing that?","I don't recall.","OK. I recall your palm being up. OK?","Alright.","Let me pick a piece of paper up. Your palm would be down when you pick something up.","Yeah, it probably would be. I recall picking the paper up.","And I know it's hard to describe here on on tape but actually what I saw was your fingers come underneath the stall, so you're actually ta...touching the bottom of the stall.","I don't...I don't recall that. I don't believe I did that. I don't...I don't do those things.","I saw I saw your left hand and I could see...I could see the the gold wedding ring when when it went across. I could see that. You know I can. I can see...","Wait a moment. My left hand was over here...","I saw...there's a...","...and my right hand was next to you.","I could tell it was my, uh, I could tell it was your left hand because your thumb was positioned in a, uh, face-forward in a certain motion. Your thumb was on this side, not on this side.","Well, we could dispute that. I'm not going to fight you in court but I I reached down with my right hand to pick up the paper.","I'm telling you that I see that so I know it's your left hand. Also I could see a gold ring on this finger so it's obvious that it was the left hand.","Yeah, OK. My left hand was in the direct opposite of the stall from you.","OK.","You you travel through here frequently, sir?","I do, um, almost weekly.","Maybe you've been successful in these bathrooms before?","I go to that bathroom regularly.","Do you partake in any of other activity?","No, Absolutely not. I don't seek activity in bathrooms.","It's embarrassing.","Well it's embarrassing for both of us. I'm not going to fight you.","I know you're not going to fight me, but that's not the point. I would respect you and I still respect you, I don't disrespect you but I'm disrespected right now and I'm not trying to act like I have all kinds of power or anything but you're sitting here lying to a police officer!","Uh uh, well...I I I don't want...","It's not a judgment that came from somebody else! I'm being serious to this, OK? I'm trained for this and I know what I'm doing! And I saw you put your hand under there and you're gonna sit there...admit it!","I I put my hand down.","You put your hand and rubbed it on the bottom of the stall with your left hand...","But wait a moment!","...and I I'm not dumb. I can tell...","If I if I had turned sideways...that was the only way I could get my left hand over there.","Not that hard for me to reach all...from my hand to that. It's not that hard. It does happen every day up here now. OK?","Alright.","I'm just I'm just...I guess I'm just...I want to say I'm disappointed in you, mister. I just really am. I expected from the guy we get out of the hood that you...I mean, people vote for you!","Yes. They do and...","Unbelievable. Unbelievable!","I'm a respectable kind of person and I don't do these kind of...","Where's your respect right now, though?","But I didn't use my left hand. I reached down with my right hand like this just to pick up a piece of paper.","Was your gold ring on your right hand at any time today?","Of course not. Try to get it off. Look at it.","OK, then it was your left hand. I saw it with my own...","Alright. You saw something that didn't happen.","Embarrassing. Embarrassing. Alright. This is embarrassing!

She slided out.\n\nShe did this\nTo me promised to go on a trip\nI am all waiting prepared\nSuitcases and tickets\nShe comes and says her other friend finds out she\nCan't go she guessed about it. I KICKED her out\n\nOh we are still together\nSometimes. But love is horrible. I thought\nYou might be the best\nPerson to talk to Patrizia since you\nLove women and are a woman\nYourself. You may be right Patrizia\n\nSaid. But this woman who abandons\nYou I think you should\nDisappear. Though maybe with this woman\nDisappearing won't work.\nI think not disappear.\nIt's too bad I don't know her\n\nIf I knew her if I could see her\nJust for ten minutes--I'm afraid\nIf you saw her you might take\nHer away from me.

I went but not \nHiding and not confronting.\nPatrizia: What did she say? I said \nThe same things. Patrizia said\nDid you see love in her eyes? I said\nNo. I didn't. I saw\n\nSomething else.

Of course, Eurydice was a part\nOf this. Then one day, everything changed. He rends\nRocks into fissures with lament. Gullies, hummocks\nCan't withstand it. The sky shudders from one horizon\nTo the other, almost ready to give up wholeness.\nThen Apollo quietly told him: \"Leave it all on earth.\nYour lute, what point? Why pick at a dull pavan few care to \nFollow, except a few birds of dusty feather,\nNot vivid performances of the past.\" But why not?\nAll other things must change too.\nThe seasons are no longer what they once were,\nBut it is the nature of things to be seen only once,\nAs they happen along, bumping into other things, getting along\nSomehow. That's where Orpheus made his mistake.\nOf course Eurydice vanished into the shade;\nShe would have even if he hadn't turned around.\nNo use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel\nOf recorded history flashes past, struck dumb, unable to \n   utter an intelligent\nComment on the most thought-provoking element in its train.\nOnly love stays on the brain, and something these people,\nThese other ones, call life. Singing accurately\nSo that the notes mount straight up out of the well of\nDim noon and rival the tiny, sparkling yellow flowers\nGrowing around the brink of the quarry, encapsulizes\nThe different weights of the things. \n\t\t\t\t\tBut it isn't enough\nTo just go on singing. Orpheus realized this\nAnd didn't mind so much about his reward being in heaven\nAfter the Bacchantes had torn him apart, driven\nHalf out of their minds by his music, what it was doing to them.\nSome say it was for his treatment of Eurydice.\nBut probably the music had more to do with it, and\nThe way music passes, emblematic\nOf life and how you cannot isolate a note of it\nAnd say it is good or bad. You must\nWait till it's over. \"The end crowns all,\"\nMeaning also that the \"tableau\"\nIs wrong. For although memories, of a season, for example,\nMelt into a single snapshot, one cannot guard, treasure\nThat stalled moment. It too is flowing, fleeting;\nIt is a picture of flowing, scenery, though living, mortal,\nOver which an abstract action is laid out in blunt,\nHarsh strokes. And to ask more than this\nIs to become the tossing reeds of that slow, \nPowerful stream, the trailing grasses\nPlayfully tugged at, but to participate in the action\nNo more than this. Then in the lowering gentian sky\nElectric twitches are faintly apparent first, then burst forth\nInto a shower of fixed, cream-colored flares. The horses\nHave each seen a share of the truth, though each thinks, \n\"I'm a maverick. Nothing of this is happening to me,\nThough I can understand the language of birds, and\nThe itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is \n   fully apparent to me.\nTheir jousting ends in music much\nAs trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm\nAnd is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees, now, \n   day after day.\"\n\nBut how late to be regretting all this, even\nBearing in mind that regrets are always late, too late!\nTo which Orpheus, a bluish cloud with white contours,\nReplies that these are of course not regrets at all,\nMerely a careful, scholarly setting down of\nUnquestioned facts, a record of pebbles along the way.\nAnd no matter how all this disappeared,\nOr got where it was going, it is no longer\nMaterial for a poem. Its subject\nMatters too much, and not enough, standing there helplessly\nWhile the poem streaked by, its tail afire, a bad\nComet screaming hate and disaster, but so turned inward\nThat the meaning, good or other, can never\nBecome known. The singer thinks\nConstructively, builds up his chant in progressive stages\nLike a skyscraper, but at the last minute turns away.\nThe song is engulfed in an instant in blackness\nWhich must in turn flood the whole continent\nWith blackness, for it cannot see.

and you figure it\n might as well be spring\n\n            now thats a little different from springs i\n remember where i came from      in the east when its spring\n      boy are you ready for it      if you lived in new york\n city or upstate new york about 130 miles north of the city\n      the way you'd know spring was coming was that around the\nend of march you'd hear rolls of thunder or cannonades that\n  would mean the ice was breaking on the river you'd say gee\nit must be spring the ice is breaking on the river      and it\n was like a series of deep distant drum rolls\n  brrrrrrrrrrmbrrrrrrrrrrrm      and you didn't feel much\nbetter about it      because the sky was still gray and cold\n and the trees were still bare\n\n            in fact you felt better in january because the snow\nseemed to keep you warm especially when the temperature got\n down around zero and the snow was piled up around the house\nand along the roadside      because after every snow the snow\n  ploughs would clear out the road and pile up the snow along\n the roadside into a wall from six to ten feet high that\n would shield the houses from the wind and you'd shovel out a \npathway to the street      but inside it was warm      and pretty\n  much everybody in this little town of north branch felt\n insulated and warm and pretty good in january as long as the\n  heating fuel held out      and they didn't feel too bad in\nfebruary either\n\n            but when the spring came      in march      and you\n heard the dull cannonade on the river      thats when you\nstarted to feel bad      because it had been so cold and bare\n and gray      and you had been holding out so long for the\nwild mustard and the goldfinches      and maybe the coming of\n the quince      that the sound coming off the river      that\n  seemed to promise an entry into the land of the hearts\n desire      which you knew would take another month at least\n      made you feel real bad\n\n            so thats why when the spring came to north branch at\nthe end of march      it seemed that every year two people would\n hang themselves off their back porch      because they couldn't\n  wait anymore\n\n      but there was the other side of spring and you\nexpected great things of it      because you had read all those\n marvelous sweet and jingling poems by those provençal\nbullshitters waiting for spring to come so they could go out\n into the fields and fuck and kill people      brash and noise\npoems that went on as i remember something like \"oh spring is\n here the birds are singing lets go out and fight some\n  battles and make it in the grass\" in a cheerful jingling and\n very overrated way\n                             that my friend paul blackburn did the best\n he could with      which was to bury the jingle and jazz up the\nnoise a bit      to make them sound a little bit like ezra\n pound and a little bit like paul doing an east village macho\n  number      and a lot better than they sound to my ears in\n provençal      and with poetic generosity he covered up the\nbanality of their vocabulary and their tedious ideas if you\n could call their attitudes ideas and it all sounded so\ncheerful that we thought it must have been a good idea to sit\n in toulouse and welcome the spring\n\n            but dont you believe it      toulouse is a dreadful\nplace and nobody wants to be there      everyone in toulouse\n would rather be in paris      so if you have a choice about\nthe spring you dont want to spend it in toulouse\n                                                             paul actually \n lived there for a while      and he was always running off to\nparis or mallorca or to spain\n\n            but wherever you are you are likely to have this\nidea of what it means for spring to come      and you know how\n it will come and when it will come      because in your\nexpectations it always comes      in a neat order the way\n  seasons do      because there are exactly four of them and\nthey are very nicely named and there are exactly three months\n in them and they very obediently follow the astronomical

So now I think I've learned all I want after I have learned all\nthis. I know how to straighten metals and all that. I forgot to say\n\"Hello\" to you. The reason why I am writing to you is about a job,\nmy Parole Officer told me that he got letter from and that you want\nme to go to work for you. So I wanted to know if its truth. When\nI go to the Board in Feb. I'll tell them what I want to do and where\nI would like to go, so if you want me to work for you I'd rather have\nyou sent me to your brother John in Tonapah and place to stay for\nmy family. The Old Lady says the same thing in her last letter that \nshe would be some place else then in Bishop, thats the way I feel\ntoo.and another thing is my drinking problem. I made up my mind\nto quit my drinking, after all what it did to me and what happen.\n     This is one thing I'll never forget as longs as I live I never want\nto go through all this mess again.

The yellow squeak of rubber on oak\n    wakes rivers of grain -- what does it matter \nthat this matter jumps back or breaks for open court --\n    sometimes you only stand and scream,\nwave both arms, put it on the floor and drive,\n    lay it up, put it down, take it home.\n\t\n                    6\n\nLet me find the keys says Candace \n    let's go says William the water\nnibbles at the bank sunlight shafts\n    the fog      wait says Candace\nclouds back off the water\n    what else the boat suspended\nglint gray along the gunnels\n    here they are I've found them\nthe washing machine idles in its cycle\n    sun shattered in water slaps\nlet's go says William      the legs follow\n    the surface tension      the door closes\nthe car starts the green wave slides\n    under the boat      a day begins.\n\t\n                    7\n\nSlow it down, bring it down, bring it\n    on home, tympanum of the trumpet-\nflower, raised hood, swollen yellow face,\n    pathological woe standing\nin rank grass against the Hurricane fence,\n    half a brick bewildered, half\ncarried through slatted shadows, cracked\n    bell shrouded by buildings, doorways\nlistening, patiently waiting for someone to open\n    a paper bag and bring out the horn\nand this one time it sounds exactly like\n    laughter, wind blows in your face,\nfrom a high window in metallic light\n    long green trumpets beat back rain. \n\t\n                     8\n\nWhen the instruments linger in the band room,\n    snare leaning into itself,\ntuba beached against green cinderblock,\n    do they riff where a fault opens,\nmake a crazy line in space, does brass \n    lie in bronze alloy, does longing\nbreathe in acoustic energy? Notes hang \n    to the skirt of the bell \nlike a city of light for a moment.\n    A tire spooks the gravel, you hear talk\nabout the weather, the leaning toward\n    and then away. Pierce the blind\nto better hear the music, the fall \n    of each sound and pause between.\n\t\n                    9\n\nIt damages people when they do not understand\n    the healing power of friendship.\nI am damaged. The left front light of my transport\n    is out. A day doesn't pass. An hour\ndoes not go by. There are minutes that glow\n    in human flesh. A trumpet has a voice.\nA place lives in music of people and time.\n    These are not things I know.\nThings of the air are also not thought of\n    in time of need. That is why the passive\nvoice is so active in distortion, and well \n    to note that a slur is more expressive\nthan a sharp note timed to surface admiration,\n    though the fool in me shines to perfection. \n\t\n                    10\n\nSoft percussive no-look pass of summer,\n    flexion of bell, white seed\nof longing and forgetfulness -- I remember\n    stopping on the way home from school\nat a car showroom, perching on vinyl I could smell\n    thinking I don't belong here\nand the place about to close. I hold the page\n    of music so you can see it, William,\nyour face reddens, your foot taps eight times \n    to push breath past unbelievable seconds,\na dandelion head floats out of sight\n    senseless and alive, full of feather\nand plume, empty to itself wherever\n    it flies, drifting from its own heart. \n\t\n                    11\n\nThe dog growls, a low unearthed intent stands\n    up on back of the neck -- I am here and\nsomewhere else -- back in time maybe, fingers\n    tap the valves. Make two trumpets\nof silver Yahweh said to Moses --\n    and make them play flat and sharp notes\nat the same time said Ornette Coleman,\n    no loose lipping. Wake the memory.\nWake the present tense. The tongue wicks the mouthpiece.\n    Horripilates the cause. Lights up the argument.\nA column of air moving through an empty place,\n    three stops, an opening outward\ntoward no purpose or proof beyond the time\n    when people will not hear it. \n\t\n                    12\n\nMy father's there. Like fugitive dust\n    seeping through cracks and keyholes in Oklahoma\nin the early 30's. What happens when I try\n    to hold him is my arms pass through air.\nGoodbye   goodbye    to the river and to\n    green metallic leaves.  I leave\nthe darkness which sat on my shoulders\n    for love talk and grace of music.\nStill, there are strains of darkness\n    dear to light.  I found a photograph\nunder the couch.  My father barbecuing\n    chicken with his shirt off, skin brown\nas a berry.  Grinning from the other side.\n    Into the lens.  Of light and song. \n\t\n\t\n          II. Shout Trumpet\n\n                    1\n\nWhen passing the Trumpet in Zion Church,\n    red brick soaked with morning rain,\nfour cars parked on slickened blacktop,\n    marked yellow lines, redbud clusters,\nheart-shaped lavender pods, I keep hearing\n    my own minor key. Even so,\na person puts a thumb out, an awning\n    cantilevers, traffic comes\nto a rolling stop. Through an open window\n    high bright notes clarify the air\nback to March wind, locked doors, to those who\n    have lost their love, decided\nto go and not come back: the high C\n    of incalculable motion. \n\t\n                     2\n\nAt the Trumpet in Zion they do the laying\n    on of hands -- your long hair\npasses over me, the purpose of\n    the body hidden in the word.\nThinking nothing.  Resembling an eighth note.\n    If the rapture taketh then where \ndoes the body go when hands lie down on air?\n    A flag dragged through the iris\nupside down.  Desire runs through its stops --\n    the dance rises to water level.\nWhat happens inside music to make it run\n    over arms and legs like a squirrel?\nToot toot go to the water to the river\n    of folded wings,\n\t\n                    3\n\nwhere catalpa shade holds a body of gnats \n    just the shape of smoke and water \nsaturates yellow air and a water moccasin\n    displaces the imagination --\nnot away from but toward where the world \n    reaches and a song carries across water,\none they've been singing all along, \n    the same notes and fears,\nthe sound of pure tones. I wouldn't know it\n    if I heard it. I might not\nknow if it were only mine.\n    I would like to think I could clearly hear\nthe music as it calls across so \n    I could know what you know. \n\t\n                    4\n\nBats are back. Looping the Mulberry. Concentric \n    gravitational waves. I think I notice \nmy own radar. I loll in a yellow chair \n    with two ear plugs connected to Art Porter.\nArt Porter Junior in background on clarinet.\n    Little Rock's own. Follow the ogive turns\npast Maybelline to Telegraph Road, past\n    Jimmy Doyle's and the white birches,\nsigns for Alltel and Jesus, SunCom,\n    and Ruby Lube. Are you a holy roller\nWilliam asks his grandmother. No but I'm\n    spirit-filled. Her sisters' faces \nghost across her own face as it is -- Jean, \n    Billie in her garden, pious Lucille.\n\t\n                    5\n\nI ask myself riddles in sleep and part of me\n    thinks it knows the answers. My\nbody leaks, my ignorance, my desire. I keep a\n    gold tooth which is not the trumpet, \nwood landing over water knock, photon locked \n    in early light wrapped around \na cove, people in a boat, not much talking \n    but it echoes, love is there, when\nwill I ever believe, fill the body up and sing.\n    A wireless chip with beams of light carries \nitself in your eye. Who sleeps upside down\n    on a ledge with toes turned in, dreams of making \nlove mid-air, only you and me in water? Bats are back. \n    I feel a scarf of air rush past.\n\t\n                    6 \n \nSome mean ass little red bug just bit the shit out of me!\n    So why does it grease the room with soulless\nnasal noise, no antennae for opposites,\n    alighting on the trumpet case?  Seven years\nof mending, leaving and coming back through you,\n    I think I can hear syncopation\nin the last half of the beat, cancellation\n    too, but I only want to touch the button\non your blouse.  The hi-hat clears the moment.\n    Out of nowhere you came to me.\nWhere is memory with its leaning sideways solo\n    under a stone weight?  Out of nowhere\nyou came back.  Today and today an old wind blows,\n    music flares above the grasstips.\n\t\n                     7\n\nWhen the moon stares from its forehead \n    and sound waves and particles\nknock on tiny hairs in the inner ear, \n    information travels -- how can one not know\nthe only pressure occurs at a molecular\n    level?  A channel forms in the flow of ions.\nWhen one whacks at a cloud of flies,\n    one clarifies that insects don't know where\nthe hell they are -- they can't hear\n    right so spend their remaining days\ncomplaining that music by itself is trivial.\n    Their bristles get bent, ions \nflow in to trumpet the brain, but still\n    no hard high note, no upward rip.\n\t\n                     8\n\t\t\t\t\t \nPlumbline of the asters, music caught inside\n    the throat, the implacability, the fluted crescent\nof the body, the temple, the infarcted heart,\n    the age of reason, the tap tap tap of the baton:\none time one steps off the porch two stories high,\n    next the song sings itself:\nthe air, the ambient glue, the tongue\n    in mid-salute, the coup de langue,\nthe nation at war, the wormhole connecting nothing\n    to nothing, the creak of heaven over\nthe creek, the flat speckled rock, the event\n    horizon, the accretion disk, the no\nwhich means no, the wide swing under stars,\n    the water, the verb, the hidden grammar.\n\t\n                    9\n\nNot long ago a fly landed in the butter.\n    The buzz stumbled, the the stared out\nfrom the portable computer, the astral light\n    combined with the high speed line\nto toot back an unheard, unseen opinion\n    so popular here in the South.\nI reach for you and nothing, not anything\n    from all the days of walking, breathing\nin and out, waking to change and resemblance,\n    quickened to the task of words,\ntime and timing unsung -- belly to belly,\n    keyboard to hyperthought, one wing\ngleaming on a salt sweet brick like a face\n    in the screen, increased singularity.\n\t\n                    10\n\nI hear the neighbors talking over the fence --\n    \"He came driving up in that turd-colored\nconvertible and didn't even open the door\n    when he saw his stuff all flayed out\nin the bushes and grass, his shirt with the sleeve\n    drooping over the hostas . . .\"  The glass doors\nscreech, the monarch glisses over standing water,\n    the ego in its drifting boat interminably waits.\nWe have no ideas but why should we say goodbye?\n    The signature and sign don't mean\nthe end of it.  White azalea blossom stuck to mud.\n    That is the end of winter, this\na preoccupation with weather which has nothing\n    more than last night on its mind.\n\t\n                    11\n\nThunder and rain all day like the drumming \n    of Zutty Singleton.  Ivy gropes\nthe fern, a sprig of oak pollen navigates \n    over two bar breaks.  One or two\noctaves over, like a ghost flattened out, down\n    the basement, up one flight\nto the dirty silver door with Judas hole, to a few\n    tables and wicker chairs, late afternoon -- that's\nwhere to hear a phrase turn.  The upright\n    shakes the floor, and when\nhowever fast the falling torrent flows --\n    stop that please thinks management if people \nstand too long and listen -- the whole world knows\n    in wind when self assured, the roses blow.\n\n                    12\n\nYou know that silo in Oklahoma, the one with\n    chipped tooth on the way to Grandma's house\nwhere apple blossoms lit the way to certain hell?\n    Well, it's gone now.  The leaping light\nand silence.  Through channels of urgent voluntary\n    sing-song, passing tones in the hallway\nmirror, tension through the saunter of water cooled\n    air, all is gone.  You don't have to remember.\nOnly that violation in the upper registers which\n    sounded and does sound in houses\njust a few blocks over, and in fact, in this house\n    which is hot at night and cunning,\nwaits for a future.

Wave-peeled, worn to gray, inch \nthick, it was a first rate stirring stick.\nApprenticed on my stool, I sang a rhyme \nof Simple Simon gone afishing \nand poked the clothes around the cauldron\nand around.  The wringer was risky.\nTouch it with just your fingertip,\nit would pull you in and spit you out\n\nflat as a dishrag.  It grabbed Mother \nonce--rolled her arm right to the elbow.\nBut she kept her head, flipped the lever\nto reverse, and got her arm back, pretty\nand round as new.  This was a story\nfrom Before.  Still, I seemed to see it--\nmy mother brave as a movie star, \nthe flattened arm pumping up again, \n\nlike Popeye's.  I fished out the rinsing \nswimmers, one by one.  Mother fed them\nback to the wringer and they flopped, flat,\ninto baskets.  Then the machine peed \nright on the floor; the foamy water \ncurled around the drain and gurgled down.  \nMother, under the slanting basement \ndoors, where it was darkest, reached up that \n\nmiraculous arm and raised the lid.\nSunlight fell down the stairs, shouting \n\"This way out!\"  There was the day, an Easter \negg cut-out of grass and trees and sky.  \nMother lugged the baskets up.  Too short \nto reach the clothesline, I would slide down \nthe bulkhead or sit and drum my heels \nto aggravate the troll (Who's that trit-\n\ntrotting...) and watch.  Thus I learned the rules \nof hanging clothes: Shirts went upside down, \npinned at the placket and seams.  Sheets hung \nlike hammocks; socks were a toe-bitten \nrow.  Underpants, indecently mixed, \nflapped chainwise, cheek to cheek.  Mother\ntook hold of the clothespole like a knight \ncouching his lance and propped the sagging \n\nline up high, to catch the wind.  We all\nwere airborne then, sleeves puffed out round  \nas sausages, bottoms billowing,\nlegs in arabesque.  Our heaviness\nwas scattered into air, our secrets\nbleached back to white.  Mother stood easing \nher back and smiled, queen of the backyard\nand all that flapping crowd.  For a week\n\nnow, each day, we'd put on this jubilee,    \nwalk inside it, wash with it, and sleep\nin its sweetness.  At night, best of all,\nI'd see with closed eyes the sheets aloft,\npajamas dancing, pillow cases \nshaking out white signals in the sun,  \nand my mother with the basket, bent\nand then rising, stretching up her arms.","\n"],"1319":["\nI wind my way across a black donut hole\nand space that clunks.\nOnce I saw on a stage,\nas if at the bottom of a mineshaft,\nthe precise footwork\nof some mechanical ballet.\nIt was like looking into the brain\nof a cuckoo clock and it carried\nsome part of me away forever.\nNo one knows when they first see a thing,\nhow long its after image will last. \nProust could stare at the symptom of a face\nfor years, while Frank O'Hara, like anyone with a job,\nwas always looking at his watch.\nMy favorite way of remembering is to forget.\nPlease start the record of the sea over again.\nCall up a shadow below the pendulum of a gull's wing.\nIn a city of eight million sundials, nobody has any idea\nhow long a minute really is.","\n"],"1320":["\ndespite books kindled in electronic flames.\n\nThe locket of bookish love\nstill opens and shuts.\n\nBut its words have migrated\nto a luminous elsewhere.\n\nNeither completely oral nor written —\na somewhere in between.\n\nThen will oak, willow,\nbirch, and olive poets return\nto their digital tribes —\n\ntrees wander back to the forest?","\n"],"1321":["The sky is melting.

And those who heard it\nFelt a hurt in their hearts and thought they were hearing\nThe song of a night bird. They sat up in their beds, and then\nThey lay back down again. In the night wind, the goat's head\nSwayed back and forth, and from far off it shone faintly\nThe way the moonlight shone on the train track miles away\nBeside which the goat's headless body lay. Some boys\nHad hacked its head off. It was harder work than they had imagined.\nThe goat cried like a man and struggled hard. But they\nFinished the job. They hung the bleeding head by the school\nAnd then ran off into the darkness that seems to hide everything.\nThe head hung in the tree. The body lay by the tracks.\nThe head called to the body. The body to the head.\nThey missed each other. The missing grew large between them,\nUntil it pulled the heart right out of the body, until\nThe drawn heart flew toward the head, flew as a bird flies\nBack to its cage and the familiar perch from which it trills.\nThen the heart sang in the head, softly at first and then louder,\nSang long and low until the morning light came up over\nThe school and over the tree, and then the singing stopped....\nThe goat had belonged to a small girl. She named\nThe goat Broken Thorn Sweet Blackberry, named it after\nThe night's bush of stars, because the goat's silky hair\nWas dark as well water, because it had eyes like wild fruit.\nThe girl lived near a high railroad track. At night\nShe heard the trains passing, the sweet sound of the train's horn\nPouring softly over her bed, and each morning she woke\nTo give the bleating goat his pail of warm milk. She sang\nHim songs about girls with ropes and cooks in boats.\nShe brushed him with a stiff brush. She dreamed daily\nThat he grew bigger, and he did. She thought her dreaming\nMade it so. But one night the girl didn't hear the train's horn,\nAnd the next morning she woke to an empty yard. The goat\nWas gone. Everything looked strange. It was as if a storm\nHad passed through while she slept, wind and stones, rain\nStripping the branches of fruit. She knew that someone\nHad stolen the goat and that he had come to harm. She called\nTo him. All morning and into the afternoon, she called\nAnd called. She walked and walked. In her chest a bad feeling\nLike the feeling of the stones gouging the soft undersides\nOf her bare feet. Then somebody found the goat's body\nBy the high tracks, the flies already filling their soft bottles\nAt the goat's torn neck. Then somebody found the head\nHanging in a tree by the school. They hurried to take\nThese things away so that the girl would not see them.\nThey hurried to raise money to buy the girl another goat.\nThey hurried to find the boys who had done this, to hear\nThem say it was a joke, a joke, it was nothing but a joke....\nBut listen: here is the point. The boys thought to have\nTheir fun and be done with it. It was harder work than they\nHad imagined, this silly sacrifice, but they finished the job,\nWhistling as they washed their large hands in the dark.\nWhat they didn't know was that the goat's head was already\nSinging behind them in the tree. What they didn't know\nWas that the goat's head would go on singing, just for them,\nLong after the ropes were down, and that they would learn to listen,\nPail after pail, stroke after patient stroke. They would\nWake in the night thinking they heard the wind in the trees\nOr a night bird, but their hearts beating harder. There\nWould be a whistle, a hum, a high murmur, and, at last, a song,\nThe low song a lost boy sings remembering his mother's call.\nNot a cruel song, no, no, not cruel at all. This song\nIs sweet. It is sweet. The heart dies of this sweetness.\n\n","\n"],"1347":["The nights were long and cold and bittersweet,","And he made a song for the hell of it.","She stood by the window, a heavenly light","Who created havoc for the hell of it.","He used to fondle every skirt in sight,","Then he fell in love—that’s the hell of it.","Now there’s a courtyard with an abject knight","Yodeling his head off for the hell of it.","O poor me, my Lady, my hopeless plight!","She married a prince for the hell of it.","Honorable, unsatisfied, illicit—","Why bring it up?

Our guide was excellent:\nfluent in English, and intelligent,\nwilling to answer questions patiently\nand to wait out our jokes. The history\nof Salvador flew past. At Tororo\nwe slowed as much as the traffic would allow,\nto see the Orixas dancing on the lake\nin their bright skirts. The road we took\nsped past high-rise apartment neighborhoods,\nthen scattered shacks, then nothing but deep woods\nof trees I didn’t recognize and lands\nthat seemed to be untouched by human hands.\nWe stopped in a village, where it was market day.\nWe walked among the crowds, taller than they\nand kilos heavier, tasting jackfruit\nand boiled peanuts, embraced by absolute,\nrespectful welcome, like visiting gods\nwhose very presence is good news. Our guide\nsuggested a rest stop. We were sipping Coke\nwhen a man came into the shop and quietly spoke\nto our guide, who translated his request:\nWould we come to his nightclub, be his guests?\nWe didn’t understand, but shrugged and went\na few doors down the street. \"What does he want?\"\nwe asked. The club hadn’t been opened yet;\nby inviting us in, the owner hoped to get\nour blessings for it. Which we humbly gave:\nvisiting rich American descendants of slaves.\n\nFor hours we drove through a deep wilderness,\nlaughing like children on a field-trip bus.\nWe made a side trip to the family home\nof Bahia’s favorite daughter and son,\nthe Velosos, Bethania and Caetano,\nin the small town of Santo Amaro.\nThe greenery flew by until the descent\ninto a river valley. There we went\nto a nice little restaurant to dine\non octopus stew, rice, manioc, and wine.\nThen we crossed a rickety bridge behind a dray\ndrawn by a donkey, and wended our way,\nat last, to Cachoeira, an old town\nof colonial buildings, universally tan\nand shuttered, darkly lining narrow streets.\nA tethered rooster pecked around our feet\nin the souvenir shop. At the convent\nI wondered what the statues really meant:\nWas it Mary, or was it Yemanja\nin the chapel, blue-robed, over the altar?\nWas it Mary on the glass-enclosed bier,\nher blue robe gold-embroidered, pearls in her hair,\nor was it the Orixa of the sea?\nThere were no Sisters around for us to see;\nthey were in solitude, preparing for the Feast\nof the Assumption, when the Virgin passed\npainlessly from this world into the next,\n","Aiye"," to ","Orun",". Posters showed them decked\nout for their big Assumption Day parade,\nbig, handsome mamas wearing Orixa beads,\nwhite turbans and blouses, red shawls, black skirts.\nThe man in their gift shop was an expert\non the Sisters’ long struggle to find a way\nto serve the Christian Church and Candombl .\nThe eldest Sister is called \"the Perpetual Judge\";\nevery seventh year, she becomes the bridge\non which the Virgin Mary crosses back,\nsorrowing love incarnate in a black\nninety-odd-year-old woman facing death\nand saying ","Magnificat"," with every breath.\n\nWe drove out of the valley looking back\non lightbulbs which intensified the thick,\nincomprehensible, mysterious\ndarkness of the unknown. Grown serious\nand silent in our air-conditioned van,\nwe rode back into the quotidian. ","\n"],"1360":["\r\n","Paul Green","\r\nOf course I know the story of the scorpion\r\nand the frog.

On average, each Chamorro consumes 16 tins of SPAM® each year, which is more per capita than any country in the world. Headline: Guam Struggles to Find Its Roots From Beneath Growing Piles of SPAM®. Guam, Hawaii, and Saipan have the only McDonald's restaurants that feature SPAM® on the menu. I went to the \"World's Largest K-Mart\" in Guam and I was amazed at the SPAM® display…it was like a whole \"Wall of SPAM®.\" SPAM® has a place not only in the stomachs of Guam's people, but in our hearts as well. Here SPAM® is considered a gourmet luxury and is often presented as a gift at birthdays, weddings, and funerals. Hormel even made a Hot and Spicy SPAM® especially formulated for Guam with Tabasco already added to it! A culinary legacy of American troops stationed in the Pacific during World War Two, the GIs noticed how much the people of Guam loved SPAM®, so they started to jokingly call it \"Chamorro Steak.\" Not coincidentally, SPAM® is also popular in Hawaii, the Philippines, Okinawa, and Saipan, all places with a history of a U.S. military presence. In fact, SPAM® may have been responsible for Hitler's defeat. The Allies would not have won WWII without SPAM®. Plus, it's processed so I guess we can keep it forever right? Wow, I haven't seen this much SPAM® since I lived on Guam and the car dealership there started offering 50lb bags of rice and cases of SPAM® with every purchase. The end result can be found in the newspaper's obituary pages. In 2004, Public Health reported that heart disease was the leading cause of death on Guam, representing 33.7% of deaths. You can rub the entire block of SPAM®, along with the accompanying delicious gelatinous goo, onto wood furniture. The oils from the SPAM® moisturize the wood and give the furniture a nice luster. Plus, you'll have enough left over to polish some of your neighbors' furniture. You'll be like Santa Claus meets Mr. Clean. How did I miss hearing about the \"In Honor of Guam's Liberation\" SPAM®! I thought I had collected them all! But as I got older and tried to be \"healthier\" (whatever that means, haha), SPAM® faded from my consciousness. Then I met my future wife, who is Hawaiian, and SPAM® became part of my life again. Maybe the economic downturn will help people truly appreciate SPAM® instead of loathing it. SPAM® doesn't have to be unhealthy. I eat SPAM® on a regular basis and I'm not dead yet. Just switch to SPAM® Lite. In the devastating wake of Typhoon Omar, SPAM® arrived. Hormel Foods donated 40,000 cases of the belly-filling foodstuff to the Salvation Army's disaster relief effort. That's about six million SPAM®burgers! Despite rumors, SPAM® is NOT made of such odds and ends as hooves, ears, brains, native people, or whole baby pigs. SPAM® is for realz made of pork shoulder, ham, salt, water, sugar, and sodium nitrate, if you can belief it. The name itself stands for ","Specially Processed Army Meat",", ","Salted Pork And More",", ","Super Pink Artificial Meat",", ","Squirrel Possum And Mouse",", or ","Some People Are Missing",". My uncle is the reigning Guam SPAM® king. He won the last SPAM® cook-off with his Spicy SPAM® meatballs. I will never forget the two-pound SPAM® bust of George Washington he made for Liberation Day, toasted crispy on the outside with raw egg yolk in the hollow center. The kids loved it! Only a fool would start a company in Guam that provides SPAM® protection. We don't want to be protected from SPAM® bots. For Xmas, I bought a SPAM® snow-globe featuring a can of SPAM® sitting on an island; turn it over and a typhoon swirls madly, unable to unseat SPAM® from its place of honor. I have a souvenir can I bought after seeing Monty Python's SPAM®ALOT on Broadway. It cost me $10 and is the most expensive SPAM® I've ever bought.

This, it was felt, would both delight the diner and comfort the nutrition-conscious consumer: people would be able to tell exactly what kind of flavor and texture of beef they were purchasing beforehand, and always be able to secure exactly the kind of product most likely to delight their taste, since they would know a whole lot more than ever before about the quality and kind of nourishment which the animal had received (it was a little like our own, well-established, present-day modern American system of catering to preferences for light and dark meat in chicken--by supplying each part shrink-wrapped in a separate bag in the supermarkets). The system set up by those ingenious and commercially forward-looking cattle-ranchers was remarkably efficient; and seemed--at least at first--to be destined for success. ","This is how it worked:"," First, on each animal's last day on the ranch, they attached the main, or so-called \"parent\" tag--made out according to information provided by each rancher, or their hired hands, or even (in some cases) their immediate family--to each head of livestock. The information contained on each tag would be of course be definitive, since it was compiled just before the two or three days required for shipment of the animal to the slaughterhouse--during which travel time, of course, the animal customarily doesn't eat anything, anyway.... Once at the slaughterhouse, they carefully removed the \"parent tags\"; and during the slaughtering, mechanically duplicated them numerous times, preparing perhaps hundreds of tiny labels for each animal. Immediately afterwards, at the packing plant, these miniature, or \"baby\" tags were affixed, respectively to the proper bodily parts--each section of each animal being separately and appropriately tagged, each as if with an epitaph. But then something went wrong with this means of delighting the diner, and of comforting the nutrition-conscious consumer. At first, quite predictably, the tags came out reading things like \"Much grass, a little moss, medium grain\" and \"Much grass, much grain, generally ate a lot.\" And this, as one might expect, proved (at least at first), a great pleasure to purchasers! But then tags began coming through reading things like \"A little grass, a little grain, many diverse scraps from our table\"; and \"She was our favorite pet--gave her all we had to give\"; and there was even one (featured at dinnertime one evening on network television news) which was tear-stained and which said, in a child's handwriting, \"Good-bye, Little Blackie Lamb, sorry you had to grow up--I'll sure miss you!\" And so, gradually, despite its efficiency, this system somehow ceased to delight the diner, and comfort the nutrition-conscious consumer. And this is how the practise of The Beef Epitaph became generally neglected over the course of time; and how the members of a large, nutrition-conscious, and otherwise generally quite sophisticated modern nation very much like our own, came to eat their beef--as indeed they still do today--partially or even totally blindfolded."],"1396":["\nBecause the burn's unstable, burning too hot\nin the liquid hydrogen suction line\nand so causing vortices in the rocket fuel \n\nflaming hotter and hotter as the \"big boy\"\nblasts off, crawling painfully slowly \nup the blank sky, then, when he blinks \n\nexploding white hot against his wincing\nretina, the fireball's corona searing \nin his brain, he drives with wife and sons\n\nthe twisting road at dawn to help with the Saturday\ntest his division's working on: the crowd \nof engineers surrounding a pit dug in snow \n\nseeming talky, joky men for 6 a.m., masking \ntheir tension, hoping the booster rocket's\nsolid fuel will burn more evenly than the liquid\n\nand keep the company from layoffs rumored\nduring recess, though pride in making\nchemicals do just what they're calculated to\n\nalso keys them up as they lounge behind \npink caution tape sagging inertly \nin the morning calm: in the back seat, I kick \n\nmy twin brother's shin, bored at 6:10 a.m. \nuntil Dad turns to us and says, in a neutral tone, \n","Stop it, stop it now",", and we stop and watch: \n\na plaque of heat, a roar like a diesel blasting\nin your ear, heatwaves ricocheting off gray mist\nmelting backward into dawn, shockwaves rippling \n\nto grip the car and shake us gently, flame \ndimly seen like flame inside the brain confused \nby a father who promises pancakes after, \n\nwho's visibly elated to see the blast shoot \narabesques of mud and grit fountaining up \nfrom the snow-fringed hole mottling to black slag \n\nfired to ruts and cracks like a parched streambed. \nDeliriously sleepy, what were those flames doing \nmixed up with blueberry pancakes, imaginings of honey \n\ndripping and strawberry syrup or waffles, \nmaybe, corrugated like that earth, or a stack \nof half-dollars drenched and sticky...? \n\nMy father's gentle smile and nodding head—\ngone ten years, and still I see him climbing \nslick concrete steps as if emerging from our next door\n\nneighbor's bomb shelter, his long-chilled shade \nfeeling sunlight on backs of hands, warmth on cheeks,\nthe brightness making eyes blink and blink...\n\nso like his expression when a friend came \nto say goodbye to him shrunken inside \nhimself as into a miles-deep bunker...\n\nand then he smiled, his white goatee \nflexing, his parched lips cracked but welcoming \nas he took that friend's hand and held it, held it \n\nand pressed it to his cheek...
