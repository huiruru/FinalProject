# Final Project

*This repository contains all the files needed for my final project including scratch notes*

I am collecting and performing unsupervised learning on American contemporary poets and their poetry
Contemporary poetry scope (will be refined based on available data): last half century - 1950s (post war) to now.

- New York school
- Beat
- Neo Surrealist
- Projectivist
- Language
- Feminist - confessional

Excluding Slam - or anything related to performativity of the works

I will then use the results to investigate conceptual trends in American contemporary poetry create graphs/charts 
regarding the data.
